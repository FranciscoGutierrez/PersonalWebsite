# About me

- Postdoctoral researcher @ [KU Leuven](http://augment.cs.kuleuven.be/).
- Human–computer interaction & information visualization.
- PhD in Computer Science (KU Leuven, 2019)
- Software Engineer, *Full stack developer*.

# Research

I am interested in visual analytics and communication of uncertainty, particularly, in supporting non-expert users in everyday decision-making. Also, I am researching how augmented reality can enhance the user experience on decision support systems.

# Methodology

I follow a design-centered approach that includes a scientific focus on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of behavior. Usually you can find me designing, developing and evaluating interactive visualization systems.

# Stuff

I also like sci-fi, playing guitar, photography, and lots of video games.
I have a Youtube channel [TacoLab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi1DT3PIJdtbs6T2vRhnp7w) with my buddy [Sven Charleer](http://svencharleer.com/).
